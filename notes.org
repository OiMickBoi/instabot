* DONE make a function that randomly inserts a emoji.
* TODO update download file so its methods take in a client object
  
* TODO Modify download program to use proxy and find content w/o logging into account
* TODO make a function to download all saved posts or sent posts
the idea here is to have me look for funny posts and save them. then the bot will
automatically download them.
* TODO follow for follow bot
follow people and then store them in a priority queue based on time. the people
have have been in the queue the longest will be the first to unfollow. We want to use
a priority queue instead of a normal queue so that way a week or so of time will pass
before we unfollow. that way we don't follow and immediately unfollow.
* TODO Make a program that finds the "trending" instagram posts in a certain theme
* TODO Make a proxy server 
* TODO scrape a comment to use as text
* TODO deal with ig_albums
maybe just reupload entire album for now.
